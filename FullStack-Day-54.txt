Reading Data from Database (Cursor Methods)
===================================================
To read data from a database into the application console, Python provides different cursor fetch methods.

a) cursor.fetchall()
==========================
Fetches all remaining rows of the query result at once.

Example:
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM staff")
rows = cur.fetchall()

for row in rows:
    print(row)

Key Points:
Returns list of tuples
Loads entire result into memory
Suitable for small datasets


b) cursor.fetchmany()
==========================
Fetches a specified number of rows.

Example:
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM staff")
rows = cur.fetchmany(2)

for row in rows:
    print(row)

Key Points:
Controls number of records
Memory efficient
Used for medium datasets


c) cursor.fetchone()
==========================
Fetches one row at a time.

Example:

cur.execute("SELECT * FROM staff")
row = cur.fetchone()

while row:
    print(row)
    row = cur.fetchone()

Key Points:
Returns a single tuple
Best for large datasets
Efficient and safe
